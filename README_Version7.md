# Supply Chain Product Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing pipeline on a large supply chain product dataset (27,555 rows Ã— 10 columns) using Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset contains information on various products, their categories, brands, prices, ratings, and descriptions.

## Contents

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Feature engineering: Discount calculation, rating categorization, etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights
- Brand and category analysis
- Data preparation for downstream ML tasks

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `index`: Unique product ID
- `product`: Product name
- `category`: Product's main category
- `sub_category`: Subcategory within main category
- `brand`: Brand name
- `sale_price`: Sale price of the product
- `market_price`: Market price of the product
- `type`: Product type
- `rating`: Customer rating (float, may have missing values)
- `description`: Product description

## Notebooks & Workflow

All steps are documented in a Jupyter notebook (`Supply Chain Project.ipynb`):

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

- Import libraries and suppress warnings
- Load dataset and display basic info and sample rows
- Check for nulls, data types, duplicated records, and unique values

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Identify and fill missing values for `product`, `brand`, and `description` with 'unknown'
- Impute missing `rating` values using category-wise mean, then overall mean if still missing
- Drop unnecessary columns (like `description` when not needed for analysis)

### 3. Feature Engineering

- Create a `discount` and `discount_%` feature
- Categorize ratings into bins (e.g., 0-1, 1-2, etc.)
- Visualize rating distributions and discount statistics

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Bar plots for highest-rated categories
- Pie chart for distribution of discounted vs. undiscounted products
- Brand-level average discount and rating analysis
- Product count per category and brand
- Trend visualizations for market price and other numerical columns

### 5. Insights

- Which categories and brands have the highest ratings?
- Which brands offer the highest/lowest average discounts?
- Distribution of ratings and discounts across the dataset
- Product mix across categories and brands

## Key Libraries Used

- **numpy** & **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **matplotlib.pyplot** & **seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and documentation

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository and place the dataset CSV file (`BBData -Ashwin.csv`) in the root directory.
2. Open `Supply Chain Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Notes

- The dataset is assumed to be anonymized and free of sensitive information.
- For large datasets, some visualizations may take time or require more memory.
